            <p><strong>signature:</strong> When a crash occurs, a minidump file is created by <a class="bh-help-link" href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Breakpad" target="_blank">breakpad</a>. The minidump file is uploaded to the database server and the path to the raw file is saved in the minidump field.  This minidump file is processed by a stack walking program that creates a crash report.  The crash signature is created by taking the stack frames from the stack in the crash report and munging it to produce a signature which can be used to group similar crashes. Extraneous addresses, numbers, and non-alpha characters have been removed to improve reproducibility.</p>
            <p><strong>fatal message:</strong> The warning/error message found in the log.</p>
