         <h3>Overview</h3>
         <hr class="bh-light-horz-line" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:10px;" />
         <div class="ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all bh-vis-detail-panel">
            <p>Bughunter consists of a backend where worker machines perform tests and submit the results to a database and a frontend user interface where the results can be viewed in a web browser and used to file bug reports. The purpose of bughunter is to help users find and file bugs on crashes, assertions and valgrind warnings.</p>
            <p>Bughunter performs two types of tests and organizes the results accordingly:</p>
            <h4>Site Tests</h4>
            <p>Site Tests involve testing the behaviour of the browser when loading web pages from various web sites. Currently, Site Tests consist of attempting to reproduce crashes by loading the urls reported to Socorro.</p>
            <h4>UnitTest Tests</h4>
            <p>UnitTest Tests involve running the UnitTests on Linux and Mac OS X under Valgrind's memcheck in order to discover any memory related problems as well as to record assertions encountered during the Unit Tests.</p>
            <p>Bughunter's user interface enables a user to browse this data by connecting datasets together.  You can find detailed info about the application architecture <a class="bh-help-link" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/BugHunter" target="_blank">here</a>. The application presents data in data views.  Data views can be presented in multiple panes within a single browser page or displayed in separate pages depending on what works best for a user's display.  Data views can be connected to each other when they share a data type or identifier allowing a user to explore deep relationships in the data.</p>

         <div class="ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all bh-vis-detail-panel">
            <p>Each data view has a navigation menu displayed in the top left panel. When a new navigation position is chosen the associated view will initialize accordingly.  If a data collection is selected the browser page will be cleared of all open views and replaced with the view collection that was selected.</p>

         <div class="ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all bh-vis-detail-panel">
            <p>The control panel is composed of a form with fields that pertain to the view displayed.  The form values can be modified and the view reloaded by selecting the load button at the bottom of the control panel.  The control panel form values are only applied to the associated view, with the exception of the date range.</p><p>The date range is passed on as signal data to any child view, so you can control the date range of a set of child views by making a single modification in the parent's control panel.</p><p>To look for similiarity in a particular field, first edit the field to contain the target text then insert a '%' at the beginning, end, or both beginning and end of the field data.</p>

         <div class="ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all bh-vis-detail-panel">
            <p>Data views in bughunter have a parent/child relationship that is indicated in the top panel of each view.  A view's parent can send signals to its child views when the user selects links or graphical representations of data that can send signals.  The parent/child relationship of any view is identified by a data view number "View:Some Number" that refers to the data view selected and its parent "Parent:Some Page Name, Some View Name".  Anytime a new view is opened from an existing view, that view becomes the parent.  Parents can send signals to child views that exist on different browser tabs or pages and there is no limit to the number of child views a parent can have.</p>

A date range is always displayed in the signal display panel and is prefixed with "Range:".  The date range can be set by opening the control panel and modifying the date range displayed.</p>

            <p><strong>Copy Cell Data:</strong> When selected this option will copy the contents of a given cell to the clipboard.  This feature requires the user to enable the ability in firefox.  You can allow access by entering 'about:config' in the location bar in the browser and setting 'signed.applets.codebase_principal_support=true' or installing the AllowClipboard addon and enabling clipboard access for bughunter.</p>
            <p><strong>Open URL In Window:</strong> This is only applicable to links that have a URL for content.  When selected, this will open the url in a new browser window.

            <p><strong>priority:</strong> Priority is an internal field that is used by the system to prioritize jobs. It can be useful to determine if this crash occurred while testing a url uploaded from Socorro (priority 3), while attempting to reproduce a crash (priority 0) or while testing a url which was manually uploaded by a user (priority 1).</p>
            <p><strong>socorro id:</strong> The socorro id is the primary key for the uploaded Socorro Record which was being tested. It can be used to look up the Site Test Runs associated with a Socorro Record for look up the specific Socorro Record assocated with a Site Test Run.</p>
